      <h1>Team-5 Applied Database Final Project</h1>
      <p>It is our goal to create a DBMS that provides a user friendly environment for the viewer to look for well-known people online. In this project we have selected nine most influential people from Times.com 2018 publication from the category of Pioneer, Leader, Artist, Icons, Titans. Each Participant have selected three people each. While clicking the link of the people name you will see the biography including Inventions, quotes provided by the person, occupation and relationship details of those influential people.<br><br>The proposed system utilizes a relational database as an information repository. The database will capture both metadata and detailed information about the personalities. Metadata reflects those data needed to identify the user requirement; actual data will have name of the person, his/her date of birth, place of birth, gender and occupation. Home page will have a display of all the people where the user can select the name of the personality or the image for whom the user wants to see the biography of the personality, then the other page will open and it will show the actual detail of the personality name, his/her date of birth, place of birth, gender and occupation name, achievement, parents, spouse, childhood, quotes and awards etc.</p>
